Pretty much wasted about half a day tring to see how to convert arrays of symbols
into arrays of strings. I gave up and converted everything to a string, now it passes.
I am convinced the binary options 1 and 0 would be quicker even if put intoa a hash:
e.g.

cell = {
  alive: 1,
  dead: 0
}
This would still make it readable for the stakeholders but quicker in production if needed.


// Creates a grid with hashes for each row
grid_size = 10
grid = {}
grid_size.times do |row|
  column = []
  grid_size.times do |cell|
    column << (cell+1)
  end
  row_text = (row + 1)
  grid[row_text] = column
end

puts grid
